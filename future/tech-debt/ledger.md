# Tech-debt ledger

> Living tech-debt ledger, maintained by the sweeper engine (`ava_builtins/skills/sweeper/`)
> driven by this repo's debt classes (`.agents/skills/ava-sweeper/`).
> The single "what debt is open now" view. Forward-looking (what we intend to
> fix) → lives in `future/`. Entries are agent + human maintained: humans
> set `wontfix`, and the sweeper must never re-add a `wontfix` item. Resolved
> items are deleted, not archived here — resolution history lives in git.

This is the single register for debt from every mechanism; do not create a
parallel ledger. A new mechanism, including a cap-domain "exit" registration,
records an ordinary fingerprinted entry here with its own class. PRs that
knowingly introduce debt register it here through the PR template, and the
daily debt-clearing pass reconciles this ledger.

## Entry format

Each open or wontfix item is one `###` block keyed by a stable fingerprint, so a
reconcile pass can match it across runs:

    ### <fingerprint>
    - **class**: deps | docs-aging | fail-fast | inline-marker | dead-code | boundary | skill-desc | docstring-budget
    - **status**: open | wontfix
    - **evidence**: file:line refs / command output; for `boundary`, the named
      files+symbols and one line on why it is a smell
    - **first-seen**: YYYY-MM-DD (PR #NNN)
    - **last-verified**: YYYY-MM-DD

Fingerprint convention: `<class>:<file>:<symbol>` for localized classes; a short
human-readable `<class>:<slug>` for `boundary` (spans files, no single symbol).
Mechanisms may add structured bullet fields beyond this base set (for example,
cap-domain exits use `exitType`, `expires`, and `approver`); readers ignore unknown fields.

## Open

### boundary:checkpoint-postgres-historical-walk-patch
- **class**: boundary
- **status**: open
- **evidence**: `shared/checkpoint_postgres_walks.py:install_checkpoint_postgres_walk_patch` wraps private `BasePostgresSaver._try_advance_walks` for checkpoint-postgres 3.1.2. It keeps an unseen historical target out of the cached walk cursor until a later page arrives; `shared/delta_read_compat.py` installs it for gateway and agent-host readers. The dependency version, method identity, and signature are guarded because this is a temporary third-party patch. Once langgraph#8448 / #8556 is released, run `tests/shared/test_checkpoint_postgres_walks.py`, delete the wrapper and its installation, then upgrade the checkpoint-postgres pin (405 tracks the follow-up).
- **first-seen**: 2026-09-23 (PR for task #4518)
- **last-verified**: 2026-09-23

### deps:playwright-1.62to1.63
- **class**: deps
- **status**: open
- **evidence**: `uv pip list --outdated` (synced worktree venv, 2026-09-23) reports playwright 1.62.0 -> 1.63.0; PyPI latest re-confirmed 1.63.0. `uv.lock` pins 1.62.0 while `Dockerfile:29` and `scripts/provision/install-playwright.sh:10` still provision Chromium with `PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION=1.59.0` — the wheel/browser lockstep still needs the joint bump (wheel + both pins), then the CI host refresh and the eval-image rebuild. The 1.59→1.60 entry was removed this pass (the wheel moved past 1.60 long ago; this entry carries the current state).

### boundary:ava-watcher-py-split
- **class**: boundary
- **status**: open
- **evidence**: `ava/watcher.py` is close to the 800-line ceiling (783 lines after the 2026-09-23 docstring trims; exactly 800 before them) — the per-file budget in `conventions/python-conventions.md` is enforced by `scripts/lint_code_structure.py`; new violations cannot enter the shrink-only baseline, so splitting preserves room for changes. Both R2 PRs (#3148, #3150) had to compress/offload content to stay under the cap. Candidate split: spawn/rebuild helpers vs. public API surface.
- **first-seen**: 2026-09-22 (PR #3150)
- **last-verified**: 2026-09-23

## Wontfix

### docstring-budget:ava/security.py:module
- **class**: docstring-budget
- **status**: wontfix
- **evidence**: module docstring trimmed 15 -> 6 lines this pass (soft cap 2). Kept: the module is off the default prompt surface (not in `__all_for_ava__`, not in the SDK-expand list), so the standing prompt pays nothing; the residue is the purpose + the mitigation caveat, for `help()` drill-down readers. Cutting further would drop the non-boundary warning.
- **first-seen**: 2026-09-23
- **last-verified**: 2026-09-23

### docstring-budget:ava/ui.py:serve
- **class**: docstring-budget
- **status**: wontfix
- **evidence**: trimmed 31 -> 20 lines this pass (soft cap 12). The residue is contract: five Args each carrying a real constraint (dir resolution, name charset, port range/policy, title/ttl defaults) plus the session life-cycle and `index.html` requirements — the class's Args-format-heavy allowance.
- **first-seen**: 2026-09-23
- **last-verified**: 2026-09-23

### docstring-budget:ava/watcher.py:cron
- **class**: docstring-budget
- **status**: wontfix
- **evidence**: trimmed 31 -> 19 lines this pass (soft cap 12). Residue: five Args (cron format, timezone, end_time types, name, notify) + the renewal semantics (supersede / replace / reuse) whose loss would reintroduce double-firing schedules. The class's calibration note already expected `watcher.cron` as an Args-format-heavy standing item.
